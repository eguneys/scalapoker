### Raise Amounts

[source](https://mpn.poker/tournament-rules/)
NLHE, Blinds 100-200. Post-flop, A opens with a bet of 600. B raises 1000 for total of 1600. C re-raises 2000 for total of 3600. If D wants to raise, he must at least raise the “largest bet or raise of the current round”, which is C’s raise of 2000. So, D must re-raise at least 2000 more for a total of 5600. Note that D’s minimum raise is not 3600 (C’s total bet), but only 2000, the additional raise action that C added.

Betting starts over each round with a min bet and min raise of 1bb..

### Reopening Betting 

Example 1. Series of short all-in wagers that add up to a full raise and thus re-open betting:

NLHE, Blinds 50-100. Post-flop, A opens betting for the 100 minimum.

B goes all in for a total of 125. C calls the 125,

D goes all in for 200 total and E calls 200.

Action returns to A who is facing a total raise of 100. Since 100 is a full raise, the betting is re-opened for A who can fold, call, or raise here. Note that neither B’s increment of 25 or D’s increment of 75 is by itself a full raise, but when added together they total a full raise and thus re-open the betting to “a player who is facing at least a full raise when the action returns”.

Example 1-A: At the end of Example 1 above, A smooth calls the 200 total (another 100 to him). The bet is now on C who is only facing a 75 increment. C called the 125 previously and is now facing 200 total (a 75 increment). Because 75 is not a full raise, the betting for C is not re-opened and C can either put out an additional 75 or fold, he or she cannot raise.

Example 1-B: At the end of Example 1 above, A raises the minimum (100), and makes it 300 total to C. C already has called 125 so it’s an additional 175 for C to call. 175 is more than a full raise. Since C already acted and is “now facing at least a full raise”, the betting is re-opened to C who can fold, call, or re-raise here.

Example 2. Short all-in, 2 scenarios.
NLHE, Blinds 2000-4000. Pre-flop A calls the BB and puts out 4000. B folds and C pushes all-in for 7500 total (an increment of 3500 above the 4000 BB). It’s folded around to the SB who also folds.

Example 2-A. It’s 3500 more to the BB who has not yet acted on his option. The BB can fold, smooth call the 3500, or raise by at least 4000 for a total of 11,500. The BB smooth calls and it’s 3500 more to A. A has already acted and is facing 3500 which is not a full raise. Therefore, A can only fold or call the 3500, he cannot raise because it is not “at least a full bet when the action returns to him”.

Example 2-B. The BB raises the minimum (4000), for a total of 11500. It is now 7500 to A and because 7500 is more than a full minimum raise, betting is now re-opened for A who can fold, call, or re-raise.

Here's a little summary of everything.

100/200 NL, 3 players who we'll call B, SB, and BB.

B is first to act and raises 300 on top of the big blind for 500 total. The minimum raise is now 300 on top, or 800 total.

Without announcing a raise, SB throws in a 500 chip, putting 600 in front of him. Since the raise amount was less than half of the minimum, the dealer announces that this is a call of 500, and returns 100 back to SB.

BB does the exact same thing as SB did, and throws in a 500 chip without announcing raise, putting 700 in front of him. This time the raise amount is more than half of the minimum, so the dealer announces that this is a raise, but the player must make a full raise of 800 total.

Unfortunately BB didn't have enough to complete the full raise. He only had 50 chips left so he is now all in for 750. Since no players completed a full raise over B's initial raise, neither B nor SB are allowed to reraise here. Their only options are to call the 750, or fold.
    
### Difference between Call Bet Raise

When raising, count the "called" part and the "bet" part as being two distincts components of the raise happening one after the other. So if you raise to 5 after 1 to call, you effectively first call 1 then bet 4 more.

A pot size raise is simply a raise where the amount bet is equal to the pot after the call. So if a pot is of size 1, player A bets 1 in it, player B would make a pot size raise if he "calls" 1 and then bets 1 + 1 + 1, raising to 4 total.

Similarly, a 50% pot size raise would be betting half the pot after the "call". So in facing 1 to call, 1 + half of (1 + 1 + 1), raising to 2.5 total.

If the blinds are 125/250 and someone raises to 500 :

There is 875 in the pot, and the "call" part of the raise would be 500 more = 1375
Making a pot size raise would be 500 + 1375 = 1875
Making a half pot size raise would be 500 + 1375/2 = 1187.5


125 250 500 = 875
125 250 500 (500, 1375) = (call, bet) raise to (call + bet) pot size bet
125 250 500 (250, 1125) =
